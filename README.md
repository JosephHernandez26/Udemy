 # Javascript 

In JS use the single quotes when standard quotes are already used, same as in writing. 
The standard is regular quotes but both will work just the same.

## Document

tells the javascript to look within the document

## getElementById

tells the js to get a specific element using its set "id" as reference.
    * following this, use "()" and pass the id within.
    * Pass the id name as a string - "."
 
## innerHTML

 refers the js to the text within the HTML that has been entered
    * set the new text using " = "
    * then, as a string, pass the new desired text.

## Commenting in JS

* to make a single line comment use " // "
* to make a multi-line comment use " /* " and close with " */ "

## the Variable "var"

* setting a variable is like setting a variable in math (think algebra)
* "var" we are setting the variable, then name it 
* var "name" so the variable is named "name"
* now type "=" to set the value 
* var name = "Joey" (the value is in a string)
